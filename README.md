# config\_files

These are some of my system configuration files. They are probably not of much
use to you unless you have a 2nd-generation Core 2 Duo MacBook and are having
system configuration issues yourself.


## Note to self

This repository is my root directory. Currently there is only one branch
(master), but I will create new branches as I add machines.

The gitignore file tells Git to ignore all files.
